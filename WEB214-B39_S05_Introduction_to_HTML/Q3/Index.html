    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      Chemisty is the branch of science that deals with the properties,
      composition and behavior of matter.It is fascinating field that explores
      the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical
      elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe
      for iron. H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into
      groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Equations</h2>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>
      This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<i>H</i
      ><sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (<i>O</i><sub>2</sub>) to form water (<i
        >H</i
      ><sub>2</sub><i>O</i>)
    </p>
    <h3>Important Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical
      reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and
      charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a
      molecule. while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of
      atoms in an ion.
    </p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
      Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From
      the composition of the air breathe to the reactions that power our bodies,
      chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
